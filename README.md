# Code Pal: Full Stack MERN Application

This is going to be a full stack application that will be a forum for Coders like us. They will be able to create a profile to connect with other coders, upload a picture, select language of choice, etc. It will be setup in the backend with Mongo DB and built on the frontend with React. We will be using authentication with Facebook or a user can sign up with their own username and password. There are little attributes on the pages that only coders would get enjoy the application!

# Lessons:

The lessons we have learned in this Boot camp have been amazing we started with nothing and created an entire MERN application front end backend FULL STACK. It is geared to coders and their ability to meetup, setup a profile, and chat with one another. It was created as an idea to use this application as a native app or PWA these are newer technologies and they are harder to understand because the documentation is either not as reliable or not great documentation. This was a serious learning curve and took a lot of time, studying, and hard work to fully understand what was needed to finish the application with all of the capabilities we had dreamed about upon originally thinking of the idea. 

# Takeaways:

The whole Boot Camp has been a great experience very hard work and very challenging to say the least but learning all that we could and taking all the assignments applying them to the homeworks and struggling to do so has been the biggest takeaway from this and it will be the best experience we have ever had so far in our lives. Learning to work as a team and making these application not only work but creating them from scratch has been nothing less than a very daunting task. As a group it has been a great experience and we are excited to show off our application.
